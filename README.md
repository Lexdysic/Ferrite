# Ferrite

Ferrite is a core library used for development of personal pet projects. It has a long history going back to my time in school and all the way through my game development career, up until now.

Every now and again, I come back to this code to add or update things as I encounter new ideas I want to try out or structure things in a more modern way. Because of this, it is left in a constant state of disarray.
